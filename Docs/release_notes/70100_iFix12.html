<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="SPM-126208"></a>DT032809, WorkItem:SPM-126208 - IEG crashes when clicking the currently selected section in the 'Go to section' menu</p>
<p><strong>Issue Description:</strong> <br />IEG Application Form displays an error when navigating to a previous section and then back to the current section via the left panel section navigation. The same occurs when clicking on the currently active section (without going to the previous section). <br /> <br /><strong>User Interface Impact:</strong> No <br /> <br /><strong>Steps to Reproduce:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Start the IEG script.</li>
<li>Complete the first section</li>
<li>On the second section, click on the left panel navigation to go to the first section.</li>
<li>On the first section, click on the left panel navigation to go to the second section.</li>
<li>Issue: An error message is displayed - 'This page is no longer available. Resume the form to continue.' - and the user cannot navigate to the desired section.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Resolution:</strong> <br />Previously in IEG, when a user navigated from one section to another using the section navigation panel, and then back to the current section, an error was displayed. Now, IEG properly handles this navigation to avoid an error and the user can navigate to the current section as expected. Another scenario was to select the current section.</p>
