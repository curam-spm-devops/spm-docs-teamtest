The schema consists of a set of entities that are linked based
on the business relationships between them so that the entities form a graph. APIs are also defined in the schema and represent an entry point to the graph.</p><p class="p">The system means that a client can request only the data that the client wants. It also means that the client can combine what might be defined
as multiple GraphQL APIs in the server into a single GraphQL query. As a result, significantly less network traffic passes between the client
and the backend server.</p><p class="p">In IBM Cúram Social Program Management, a GraphQL API consists of a schema definition and an implementation class, called a data fetcher. The data fetcher wraps a
facade operation from the server. A GraphQL query can be made over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), by using the GraphQL query language,
to query one or more GraphQL APIs. The response is returned in a JSON format.</p><p class="p">The GraphQL infrastructure is built into the REST application and is deployed as part of the REST ear.</p></div></article></main></body></html>
